  Generative-Coherence-Schema is a comprehensive philosophical framework exploring the
  foundations of generative systems through the integration of AI, mathematics,
  logic, and systems theory. Drawing inspiration from classical philosophical
  systematization, it develops a computational approach to metaphysics and
  examines complex systems through the lens of cybernetics and general systems
  theory. The project bridges traditional philosophical inquiry with modern
  computational methods to investigate fundamental questions about generation,
  emergence, and systemic organization.
