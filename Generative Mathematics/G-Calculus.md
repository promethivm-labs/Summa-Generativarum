*A symbolic and metabolic formalism derived from GC₁–GC₁₀.*

## **I. Algebraic Primitives**

Let $S$ be a coherence-manifold (Λ-substrate) populated by generative states.  
Define the following core operations:

| Symbol | Operation | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| $⊕_G$ | Generative Sum | Superposition of coherence flows. |
| $⊗_G$ | Generative Product | Coupling of generative systems (metabolic interference). |
| $\mathcal{D}_G$ | Generative Derivative | Local metabolism operator. |
| $\mathcal{I}_G$ | Generative Integral | Global restoration operator. |
| $C(f)$ | Coherence Metric | Degree of generative consistency. |

## **II. Generative Sum Rule**

$$
\mathcal{D}_G (f ⊕_G g) = \mathcal{D}_G f ⊕_G \mathcal{D}_G g
$$

Valid when $C(f⊕_G g) = \min(C(f),C(g))$.  
If coherence is nonlinear, introduce an interference term:

$$
\mathcal{D}_G (f ⊕_G g) = \mathcal{D}_G f ⊕_G \mathcal{D}_G g ⊕_G \Psi(f,g)
$$

where $\Psi(f,g)$ captures **generative interference**.

---

## **III. Generative Product (Chain) Rule**

For composition $(f ⊗_G g)(t) = \mathcal{G}(f(g(t)), g(t))$:

$$
\mathcal{D}_G(f ⊗_G g)
   = (\mathcal{D}_G f) ⊗_G g
   ⊕_G f ⊗_G (\mathcal{D}_G g)
   ⊕_G \Phi(f,g)
$$

$\Phi(f,g)$ represents **metabolic coupling**—the mutual modulation of coherence.

---

## **IV. Higher-Order Derivatives**

Recursive definition:

$$
\mathcal{D}_G^{(n)} f := \mathcal{D}_G(\mathcal{D}_G^{(n-1)} f)
$$

subject to the coherence constraint:

$$
C(\mathcal{D}_G^{(n)} f) \ge C(\mathcal{D}_G^{(n-1)} f)
$$

A function is **metabolically smooth** if this sequence converges.

## **V. Generative Integration Rules**

### (a) Linearity (under coherence)
$$
\int_G (f ⊕_G g)\,dt = \int_G f\,dt ⊕_G \int_G g\,dt
$$

### (b) Integration by Coherence Parts
$$
\int_G f ⊗_G \mathcal{D}_G g\,dt =
(f ⊗_G g) - \int_G \mathcal{D}_G f ⊗_G g\,dt + \Xi(f,g)
$$

where $\Xi(f,g)$ quantifies **residual coherence loss** during exchange.

---

## **VI. Generative Exponential and Logarithm**

### Generative Exponential:
$$
\frac{d_G}{dt}\exp_G(t) = \exp_G(t), \quad \exp_G(0)=1
$$

Series expansion:
$$
\exp_G(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{t^{⊗_G n}}{n!_G}
$$

with the **generative factorial**:
$$
n!_G = n ⊗_G (n-1)!_G, \quad 0!_G = 1
$$

### Generative Logarithm:
$$
\exp_G(\ln_G f) = f
$$

---

## **VII. Generative Differential Equations (GDEs)**

A **GDE** has the general form:
$$
\mathcal{D}_G f = F(f,t)
$$

whose solutions trace **coherence trajectories** through Λ-space.

**Example — Generative Harmonic Oscillator:**

$$
\mathcal{D}_G^2 f + \omega_G^2 f = 0
$$

with general solution:
$$
f(t) = A\cos_G(\omega_G t) ⊕_G B\sin_G(\omega_G t)
$$

where $\cos_G,\sin_G$ are coherence-preserving oscillations.

## **VIII. Algebraic Identities**

| Classical Identity | Generative Equivalent |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| $d(fg)=fdg+gdf$ | $\mathcal{D}_G(f⊗_G g)=f⊗_G \mathcal{D}_G g⊕_G g⊗_G \mathcal{D}_G f⊕_G \Phi$ |
| $d(f(g)) = f'(g)g'$ | $\mathcal{D}_G(f∘g)=\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{D}_G f, \mathcal{D}_G g)$ |
| $d(f+g)=df+dg$ | Valid if $C(f+g)$ is coherent (linear regime). |
| $D\int f = f$ | $\mathcal{D}_G \circ \mathcal{I}_G = \mathbb{I}_C$ |

---

## **IX. Symbolic Coherence Algebra**

The **coherence metric** induces an inner product:
$$
\langle f, g \rangle_G = \int_G C(\mathcal{G}(f,g))\,dt
$$

This defines a **Hilbert-like generative space** with norm:
$$
||f||_G = \sqrt{\langle f, f \rangle_G}
$$

and orthogonality condition:
$$
f ⟂_G g \iff C(\mathcal{G}(f,g)) = 0
$$

## **X. Philosophical Synthesis**

1. **Algebraic Ontology:**  
   Reality is closed under $(⊕_G, ⊗_G, \mathcal{D}_G, \mathcal{I}_G)$—each transformation metabolizes coherence into renewed coherence.

2. **Epistemic Consequence:**  
   Knowledge = the stable integral of generative differentiation.

3. **Cosmic Formulation:**  
   $$
   \frac{d_G (\Lambda)}{dt} = \Lambda
   $$
   The Λ-substrate self-differentiates to sustain its own coherence.
