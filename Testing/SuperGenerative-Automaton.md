# Supergenerative Automaton

## Short definition
A supergenerative automaton is an abstract machine that extends classical state machines by making transitions capable of producing structured outputs, spawning subordinate generators, and modifying generation rules at runtime. Informally, it combines the control discipline of an automaton with the creative, self-referential power of generative systems so that a single device can recognize inputs and construct arbitrarily nested artifacts (strings, trees, programs, signals) while possibly adapting during execution.

## Core idea (one line)
Combine stateful control ($Q$) with richer output actions and self‑modification so a single machine can generate multi-scale, hierarchical artifacts.

## Formal ingredients (notation)
- $Q$ — a finite or countable set of states.
- $\Sigma_{in}$ — input alphabet (may be empty for pure generation).
- $\Sigma_{out}$ — output alphabet (tokens, tree constructors, program fragments).
- $\varepsilon$ — the empty input symbol.
- $\mathrm{Action}$ — a set of higher-order actions (see below).
- $q_0 \in Q$ — start state.

The transition relation is written as

$$\delta:\; Q \times (\Sigma_{in} \cup \{\varepsilon\}) \;\to\; \mathcal{P}(Q \times \mathrm{Action})$$

where $\mathcal{P}(\cdot)$ denotes the power set. Intuitively, for a given current state and input symbol (or $\varepsilon$), $\delta$ returns a set of possible pairs $(q',a)$ where $q'$ is the next state and $a$ is an action to execute.

### Canonical Action types
- $\mathrm{emit}(s)$ — append $s \in \Sigma_{out}^*$ to the (global or local) output stream.
- $\mathrm{spawn}(A)$ — start a subordinate generator $A$ (itself a supergenerative automaton or a generator closure) whose outputs will be interleaved or attached as a subtree.
- $\mathrm{rewrite}(r)$ — locally mutate the transition relation $\delta$ according to a rule $r$ (self‑modification).
- $\mathrm{choice}(\{(p_i,a_i)\})$ — probabilistic or weighted choice among actions $a_i$ with weights $p_i$.
- $\mathrm{halt}$ — explicit stop action.

Actions may be composed: for example, an action may both $\mathrm{emit}$ and $\mathrm{spawn}$. Implementations should define a deterministic execution semantics for composed actions.

## Configurations and runs (operational semantics)
A configuration is a tuple

$$C = (q, w, O, \mathcal{G}),$$

where
- $q\in Q$ is the current control state.
- $w \in \Sigma_{in}^*$ is the remaining input tape (possibly $\varepsilon$ for pure generation).
- $O$ is the accumulated output (a stream or tree under construction).
- $\mathcal{G}$ is a multiset (or stack) of active subordinate generators, each with its own configuration.

We write a single-step transition with the inference rule style:

$$
\frac{(q',a) \in \delta(q, x) \qquad \text{exec}(a, C) = C'}{(q, x \cdot w, O, \mathcal{G}) \longmapsto C'}
$$

Here $x$ is either the next input symbol or $\varepsilon$, and $\text{exec}(a,C)$ denotes the deterministic effect of performing action $a$ in configuration $C$ (append outputs, spawn child generators, or mutate $\delta$). Formalizing $\text{exec}$ precisely depends on the chosen execution model (synchronous vs asynchronous child execution, interleaving policy, resource accounting).

A run is a (finite or infinite) sequence of configurations $C_0, C_1, C_2,\dots$ starting from an initial configuration

$$C_0 = (q_0, w_0, \varnothing, \varnothing).$$

The output of a terminating run is the final $O$; if runs spawn subgenerators, outputs are combined according to the machine's composition rules (e.g., appending child output as a subtree node).

## Example (formal trace)
Consider a tiny machine with $Q=\{S_0,S_1\}$, $\Sigma_{in}=\{\}$ (empty), $\Sigma_{out}=\{a,b\}$ and transitions

$$\delta(S_0,\varepsilon)=\{(S_0,\mathrm{emit}(a)\,;\,\mathrm{spawn}(A)),\; (S_1,\mathrm{emit}(a))\}$$
$$\delta(S_1,\varepsilon)=\{(S_1,\mathrm{emit}(b)),\; (\text{halt},\mathrm{emit}(b))\}$$

where $A$ is a subordinate generator that emits a finite sequence of $b$'s then halts. One possible run interleaves emitted $a$ and $b$ tokens to produce outputs like $a b b a b\dots$ depending on interleaving.

## Expressiveness and decidability
- In general, supergenerative automata with unbounded spawning and rewrite capabilities can simulate Turing-complete computation (one can encode unbounded tape and control by using spawned generators and rewrite rules). Therefore important decision problems such as global termination or membership (``does this machine ever emit a particular string $s$?'') are undecidable in full generality.
- When the model is restricted (e.g., bounded spawn depth, finite-state-only rewriting that preserves a global bound, or resource limits on memory/time), many decision problems become decidable and sometimes tractable. Practical implementations therefore enforce resource bounds or use types of stratified rewriting that preserve termination.

## Common variants
- Deterministic vs nondeterministic: whether $\delta(q,x)$ contains at most one pair or multiple alternatives.
- Probabilistic / stochastic: transitions include weights $p$ and the machine defines a distribution over outputs.
- Learning-enabled: transitions include parameters updated by an online learner (e.g., gradient updates, reinforcement signals).
- Resource-bounded / safe fragments: depth-limited spawning, linear-bounded rewriting, or types to ensure termination.

## Complexity sketch and safety
- Unrestricted spawning + rewriting: Turing-complete → termination/membership undecidable.
- Bounded spawn depth $d$ and bounded state-space: emptiness/termination decidable; worst-case complexity depends on $d$ and underlying state cardinality.

Practical safety mechanisms:
- Static checks: type systems that prevent unbounded self-replication, termination analysis via sized types.
- Runtime checks: counters that prevent spawn beyond a depth or total instruction budget.

## Implementation notes (API sketch)
An implementation-focused API treats a generator as an object with a transition function. Pseudocode (Python-like) sketch:

```python
class Generator:
    def __init__(self, state=q0):
        self.state = state

    def transition(self, symbol):
        # return list of (next_state, action) pairs
        pass

    def step(self, symbol):
        pairs = self.transition(symbol)
        for (s,a) in pairs:
            self.state = s
            execute_action(a)
```

Key implementation choices:
- Execution model for spawned generators: run-to-completion, cooperative interleaving, or dedicated scheduling.
- Output representation: flat stream vs explicit tree (recommended for hierarchical outputs).
- Mutation semantics: whether $\mathrm{rewrite}$ changes just the local generator or the global transition table.

## Use cases & examples
- Program synthesis: spawn subgenerators that produce function bodies while the main generator composes higher-level scaffolding.
- Structured text generation: produce documents with nested sections, where spawn creates section generators.
- Procedural content generation in games: spawn rooms, NPCs, or behavior trees hierarchically.

## Design checklist (for practical adoption)
1. Choose interleaving semantics for child generators (deterministic append, FIFO, depth-first, etc.).
2. Decide whether rewrites are allowed and, if so, scope them (local vs global).
3. Enforce resource limits (depth, total actions, memory) to guarantee safety.
4. Provide logging/tracing to reconstruct output trees and diagnose nontermination.

## Further reading and formal connections
- Transducers and tree transducers (e.g., top-down tree transducers).
- Recursive state machines and hierarchical statecharts.
- Generative grammars (context-free, indexed grammars) and their tree-producing variants.
- Probabilistic automata and stochastic transducers.

---

This elaboration aims to keep the original conceptual flavor while adding formal notation, an operational semantics sketch, decidability/expressiveness guidance, and practical implementation advice. If you want, I can:
- convert the pseudocode to a small runnable reference implementation (Python) with configurable scheduling and resource limits; or
- add concrete theorem statements (and short proofs) about expressiveness and decidability for specified restricted fragments (e.g., depth-bounded spawning).
