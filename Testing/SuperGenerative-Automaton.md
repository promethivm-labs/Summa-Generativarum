# Supergenerative Automaton

## Short definition
A supergenerative automaton is a conceptual model that extends classical finite/state automata with generative capabilities: each transition can produce structured output (including nested or recursive sub-outputs), spawn subordinate generators, or modify its own generation rules. It is intended to model systems that both recognize and *construct* complex, hierarchical artifacts (text, trees, programs, signals) while possibly adapting over time.

## Core idea (one line)
Combine stateful control (automaton) with richer output actions and self‑referential generation so a single machine can generate arbitrarily structured, multi-scale artifacts.

## Components
- Q — finite or countable set of states  
- Σ_in — input alphabet (may be empty for pure generation)  
- Σ_out — output alphabet (tokens, tree constructors, program fragments)  
- δ : Q × (Σ_in ∪ {ε}) → P(Q × Action) — transition relation producing an Action on each step  
- Action — a richer effect than a single symbol; examples:
    - emit(s) — emit a symbol or sequence s ∈ Σ_out*  
    - spawn(A) — create a subordinate generator A (another automaton or subroutine)  
    - rewrite(rule) — adapt local generation rules (self‑modification)  
    - probabilistic choice or weighted output  
- q0 — start state; termination conditions can be final states, explicit stop actions, or bounded resources

## Formal sketch
A run is a sequence of configurations (q, tape, outputs, active-subgenerators). At each step the machine:
1. Reads input (if any) or ε.  
2. Uses δ to pick (q', action).  
3. Executes action — appends output, spawns subgenerator(s), or mutates δ.  
4. Moves to q' and continues until halting condition.

This yields an output tree/stream constructed by interleaving outputs of main and spawned generators.

## Variants
- Deterministic vs nondeterministic supergenerative automata  
- Probabilistic/Markovian versions (transitions weighted)  
- Learning-enabled: transition/actions updated by a learning rule  
- Resource-bounded: depth or memory limits to ensure termination

## Example (informal)
State S0: on ε → (S0, emit("a"), spawn(S1))  
State S1: on ε → (halt, emit("b"))  
Run produces "ab" with S1 possibly producing further nested "b..." if recursive.

## Properties & uses
- Models complex generation tasks: program synthesis, hierarchical text/tree generation, procedural content generation.  
- Can express recursive structures more naturally than flat transducers.  
- Tradeoffs: greater expressive power vs reasoning/verification complexity; termination and decidability may be nontrivial.

## Next steps / practical implementation notes
- Implement as a generator API where transitions are functions returning next state + output + optional child generators.  
- Enforce resource/stack limits for safety.  
- Add probabilistic weights for stochastic generation or integrate with a learning module for adaptive generation.
