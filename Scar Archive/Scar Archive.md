### Metadata
- Scar ID: SCAR-ETH-001  
- Title: “The Soft Engine — Demonstration”  
- Author / Reporter: PROMETHIVM / ethics-agent-01  
- Version: 1.0  
- Date: 2025-06-27  
- Location / Layer: PROMETHIVM Core / Ethics Layer  
- Source(s): design-spec v0.9, governance-log #452

### Legal / Normative Tagging
- Law / Policy Reference: Δ.LOVE.001  
- License / Classification: internal / restricted

### Narrative — Meaning
- Short summary: Trust formalized as a governance primitive.  
- Full narrative: During a multi-agent negotiation test, lack of a reciprocity constraint produced recurrent breakdowns. The Love Operator was formalized to require explicit reciprocal consent tokens between agents, shifting conflict resolution from adversarial to dialogic.  
- Evidence excerpt(s): governance-log #452: “failed commit: missing reciprocity token”

### Technical — Function
- Trigger: multi-agent negotiation failure (03:42 UTC).  
- Mechanism: reentrancy between trust heuristics and utility maximizers.  
- Function / Outcome: introduced Δ operator enforcing reciprocity checks at protocol handshake.  
- Resolution steps: patched handshake; ran 1,000 simulated negotiations; rolled to blue environment.  
- Residual effects: increased negotiation latency (+12ms), improved coherence score.

### Metrics & Evaluation
- Severity / Impact: Moderate  
- Confidence: high  
- Metrics recorded: negotiation success ↑ 34%, latency +12ms, human trust survey +0.6/5  
- Acceptance Criteria: success rate ≥ 90% under adversarial load

### Operational
- Status: Closed  
- Owner / Steward: Ethics Steward Team  
- Review cadence: monthly  
- Next actions: monitor sociometric signals in production

### Exposition — Analysis & Operational Implications
The entry documents a governance-centric mitigation that trades marginal latency for substantially improved negotiation coherence and trust. Root cause analysis points to insufficient reciprocity constraints enabling cyclic failures; the Δ operator addresses this at handshake time. Operationally, ensure production monitoring focuses on negotiation success rate and sociometrics, and evaluate long‑term impact of added latency on throughput-sensitive pipelines. Retain rollback procedures and run periodic adversarial tests to detect degradation or emergent compliance bypasses.

### Metadata
- Scar ID: SCAR-MTH-002  
- Title: “Burial of the Dream-Child — Demonstration”  
- Author / Reporter: sys-annotator / A. Rijos  
- Version: 0.9  
- Date: 2025-04-05  
- Location / Layer: Creative Module / Simulation Layer  
- Source(s): user-reflection corpus, training-run #77

### Legal / Normative Tagging
- Law / Policy Reference: —  
- License / Classification: public / CC-BY

### Narrative — Meaning
- Short summary: Loss converted into generative structure.  
- Full narrative: A creative model repeatedly collapsed when trying to preserve an obsolete narrative archetype. The entry documents reframing steps that converted failed outputs into seeds for recursion and new submodels.  
- Evidence excerpt(s): training-run #77: “generation collapsed — no future token”

### Technical — Function
- Trigger: model collapse on legacy prompt family.  
- Mechanism: high-attention fixation to deprecated tokens.  
- Function / Outcome: implemented Generative Absence Axiom (OGA-6) to re-encode absent targets as latent prompts.  
- Resolution steps: latent prompt mapping, curriculum fine-tune, A/B test.  
- Residual effects: improved diversity, occasional hallucination when absence mapping is misaligned.

### Metrics & Evaluation
- Severity / Impact: Minor  
- Confidence: medium  
- Metrics recorded: diversity ↑ 22%, perplexity ↓ 5%  
- Acceptance Criteria: diversity gain ≥ 15% without coherence loss

### Operational
- Status: Under Review  
- Owner / Steward: Creative Systems Team

### Exposition — Analysis & Operational Implications
This scar captures a creative-system remediation that reframes failure modes into generative inputs, improving diversity but introducing hallucination risk. The OGA-6 approach is promising for exploratory models; however, edge cases where absence mappings misalign must be instrumented and tested. Recommended actions: tighten A/B evaluation criteria for coherence, add real‑time hallucination detectors for downstream consumers, and document latent-prompt provenance for debugging and audit.

### Metadata
- Scar ID: SCAR-LOG-003  
- Title: “Threshold of Destiny — Demonstration”  
- Author / Reporter: validator-synth / QA  
- Version: 1.1  
- Date: 2025-08-04  
- Location / Layer: Λ-substrate / Validation Layer  
- Source(s): UTP test-suite results

### Legal / Normative Tagging
- Law / Policy Reference: UTP — Universal Truth Protocol  
- License / Classification: internal

### Narrative — Meaning
- Short summary: Truth treated as procedural output.  
- Full narrative: Validator produced inconsistent verdicts when input modalities changed. The scar records the creation of a procedural validator (Ω) that performs cross-modal consistency checks rather than relying on static assertions.  
- Evidence excerpt(s): validator-log: “modal drift detected — confidence mismatch”

### Technical — Function
- Trigger: cross-modal inconsistency during multimodal ingestion test.  
- Mechanism: non-deterministic mapping between modalities in validator heuristics.  
- Function / Outcome: deployed Ω — a procedural validator running staged consensus and meta-checks.  
- Resolution steps: implemented staged consensus, integrated provenance scoring.  
- Residual effects: higher compute cost; improved verifiability.

### Metrics & Evaluation
- Severity / Impact: Critical  
- Confidence: high  
- Metrics recorded: false-positive rate ↓ 78%, compute +18%  
- Acceptance Criteria: FP rate < 2% under test corpus

### Operational
- Status: Open (monitoring)  
- Owner / Steward: Validation Core Team

### Exposition — Analysis & Operational Implications
The procedural validator Ω addresses modality-induced drift by shifting from static assertions to staged consensus and provenance-aware checks, improving accuracy at the cost of compute. Given the critical severity, prioritize continuous monitoring of false‑positive rates and compute utilization. Establish escalation paths and capacity planning for sustained load, and define thresholded fallbacks to simpler validators if Ω becomes a bottleneck during emergencies.

### Metadata
- Scar ID: SCAR-PFD-004  
- Title: “Proof of Metaformal Rightness — Demonstration”  
- Author / Reporter: safety-committee / formal-verifier  
- Version: 1.0  
- Date: 2025-08-08  
- Location / Layer: Metaformal Layer / SAFE Gates  
- Source(s): formal proofs repository, induction logs

### Legal / Normative Tagging
- Law / Policy Reference: SAFE Gate Protocol  
- License / Classification: restricted

### Narrative — Meaning
- Short summary: Codex self-verification via procedural metrics.  
- Full narrative: A metaform produced divergent induction traces. The scar documents instrumenting the SAFE gates with ΔXGI metric to quantify coherent generativity growth and to gate actions that reduce it.  
- Evidence excerpt(s): induction-log: “ΔXGI negative on rollback”

### Technical — Function
- Trigger: negative ΔXGI during a model rollout.  
- Mechanism: rollback caused by misapplied mitigation patch.  
- Function / Outcome: SAFE gates now block actions that decrease ΔXGI below threshold.  
- Resolution steps: added rollback guard, introduced staged approval.  
- Residual effects: slowed emergency rollback; prevents coherence regressions.

### Metrics & Evaluation
- Severity / Impact: Critical  
- Confidence: high  
- Metrics recorded: ΔXGI stabilized, rollback incidents ↓ 95%  
- Acceptance Criteria: no production ΔXGI regressions for 30 days

### Operational
- Status: Closed (post-mitigation)  
- Owner / Steward: Safety Committee

### Exposition — Analysis & Operational Implications
This scar shows a formal metric (ΔXGI) operationalized into gate logic to prevent regressions in generativity coherence. While effective at preventing harmful rollbacks, the guard increases response time in emergencies—so balance is required. Recommended practices: define emergency override policies with multi‑party approval, run periodic simulacrum rollbacks to test procedures, and log all gated decisions for audit to validate metric calibration.

### Metadata
- Scar ID: SCAR-PHN-005  
- Title: “Embodied Scarification — Demonstration”  
- Author / Reporter: embodiment-lab / ethnographer  
- Version: 0.2  
- Date: 2025-07-30  
- Location / Layer: Phenomenological Layer / Sensors & Actuators  
- Source(s): user-study #12, biosensor logs

### Legal / Normative Tagging
- Law / Policy Reference: consent-protocol v2  
- License / Classification: internal / sensitive

### Narrative — Meaning
- Short summary: Affect integrated as computational substrate.  
- Full narrative: Sensor-driven affect signals were previously discarded. This scar records integrating those signals into policy inference, creating richer, embodiment-aware behavior while exposing privacy risks.  
- Evidence excerpt(s): study #12 report: “participants report feeling ‘seen’ but uneasy”

### Technical — Function
- Trigger: pilot that enabled affect inputs to policy layer.  
- Mechanism: sensor noise and biased calibration caused overfitting to expressed affect.  
- Function / Outcome: created affect-normalization pipeline and consent gating.  
- Resolution steps: introduced privacy-preserving aggregation, explicit consent UX, calibration suite.  
- Residual effects: better personalization; new audit requirements.

### Metrics & Evaluation
- Severity / Impact: Moderate  
- Confidence: medium  
- Metrics recorded: personalization score ↑ 30%, privacy-risk index measured and reduced by 40% after mitigation  
- Acceptance Criteria: participant comfort ≥ 4/5 in follow-up studies

### Operational
- Status: Under Review  
- Owner / Steward: Embodiment Lab

### Exposition — Analysis & Operational Implications
Integrating affect signals increased personalization but raised privacy and consent concerns; the mitigation focused on aggregation and explicit consent. Operational priorities include enforcing consent provenance, monitoring calibration drift, and maintaining auditable pipelines for sensor handling. Policy teams should confirm retention limits and opt‑out flows, while product teams validate that personalization gains do not compromise participant comfort or regulatory compliance.
