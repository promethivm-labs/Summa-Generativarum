## Contents

This directory contains files and folders from pre-v1.2 versions of the Summa Generativarum that have been superseded by the v1.2 restructuring.

### Archived Items

#### 1. Experiments/
**Original Location:** `/Experiments/`  
**Reason for Archival:** Duplicate of `Experiments at the Edge/` folder  
**Status:** Preserved for historical reference  

**Contents:**
- Riemann Hypothesis.md
- SGA-Blueprint.md
- generative_neural_network_mathematics (4).md
- the virtual system.md

**Note:** Active experiments should use `/Experiments at the Edge/` directory.

#### 2. Axioms of Generativity.md/
**Original Location:** `/Axioms of Generativity.md/`  
**Reason for Archival:** Superseded by consolidated documents  
**Superseded By:**
- `/The 13 Core Axioms.md` (formal mathematical axioms)
- `/The 79 Invariants for Intelligibility.md` (CFPE conditions)

**Contents:**
- Axioms - Generativity.md (79 Generative Laws)
- Axioms - Mathematics.md (79 Axioms of Generative Mathematics)

**Status:** Content consolidated and formalized in v1.2 documents

---

#### 3. Conditions of Possibility for Mathematics.md/
**Original Location:** `/Conditions of Possibility for Mathematics.md/`  
**Reason for Archival:** Superseded by v1.2 CFPE formalization  
**Superseded By:**
- `/The 79 Invariants for Intelligibility.md`
- `/The Universal Conditions/` (detailed category elaborations)

**Contents:**
- CFPM - Encyclopedia.md

**Status:** Mathematics-specific conditions integrated into broader CFPE framework

## v1.2 Compliance Summary

### What Changed

**Pre-v1.2 Structure:**
- Multiple overlapping documents for axioms and conditions
- Scattered experimental content
- Mixed formal/informal presentations

**v1.2 Structure:**
- **13 Core Axioms:** `/The 13 Core Axioms.md` (formal mathematical foundation)
- **79 Invariants:** `/The 79 Invariants for Intelligibility.md` (transcendental conditions)
- **Three Architectures:** 
  - `/LPL - Logical Presupposition Lattice.md`
  - `/PCM - Paraconsistent Contradiction Metabolism.md`
  - `/PGI - Phenomenological Generativity Index.md`
- **Single Experiments Directory:** `/Experiments at the Edge/`

## Key Improvements in v1.2

### 1. Formal Rigor
- Clear distinction between universal (3) and contextual (76) invariants
- Explicit scope limitations (no overreaching metaphysical claims)
- Integration with formal proof systems (Lean4 planned)

### 2. Architectural Clarity
- Three independent, formally defined systems (LPL/PCM/PGI)
- Clear dependency graphs via LPL
- Provable convergence guarantees in PCM
- Empirically measurable metrics in PGI

### 3. Honest Scope
- Acknowledgment of Gödelian limits
- Separation of formal logic from phenomenology
- Contextual applicability domains specified
- No conflation of levels (formal/metaphysical/phenomenological)
