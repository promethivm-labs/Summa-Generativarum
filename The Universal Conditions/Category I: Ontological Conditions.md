## Category I: The Ontological Conditions

The Ontological Conditions (C₁–C₁₀) establish the fundamental **structure of Being itself**—the minimal requirements for anything whatsoever to exist, persist, and transform coherently.[^1][^2][^3]

### The Ten Ontological Foundations

**C₁: Divisibility** — Being must support internal differentiation; every entity contains distinct parts. Formally: $\forall x \in \text{Being}(x) \rightarrow \exists y,z (y \neq z \land y, z \subset x)$. (Plain English: For every thing that exists, there are at least two distinct parts contained in it — nothing is wholly without internal differentiation.) Without divisibility, no relations, properties, or distinctions are intelligible.[^2][^3][^1]

**C₂: Coherence** — Differentiated parts must remain integrated; division without disintegration. The formula $S(\text{Divided}(S) \land \text{Integrated}(S) \land \forall x,y \in S \exists \text{Relation}(x,y))$ ensures that multiplicity does not collapse into incoherent fragmentation. (Plain English: There is at least one system S that is both divided into parts and kept integrated — and every two parts of S are connected by some relation, so multiplicity stays coherent.)[^3][^1][^2]

**C₃: Substantiality** — Properties require bearers; no floating predicates without substrates. Every property $P$ necessitates some substance $x$ such that $\text{Instantiates}(x, P)$. (Plain English: For any property, there is some thing that actually has that property — properties do not exist on their own.)[^1][^2][^3]

**C₄: Persistence** — Entities retain identity through transformation; continuity across change. Formally: $\forall x, t_1, t_2(\text{Entity}(x, t_1) \land t_1 \prec t_2 \rightarrow \text{Identity}(x, t_1, t_2))$, grounding causality, memory, and development. (Plain English: If x is an entity at an earlier time t1 and t1 comes before t2, then x is the same entity at t2 — identity is preserved over time.)[^2][^3][^1]

**C₅: Transformability** — The substrate permits reconfiguration; states can transition coherently. Expressed as $\forall S, t \exists S', t'(S \rightarrow S' \land \text{coh}(S') \geq 0)$, enabling evolution, learning, and becoming. (Plain English: For any substrate S at some time there exists a later substrate S' such that S can become S' and S' remains coherent — change is possible while preserving coherence.)[^3][^1][^2]

**C₆: Potentiality** — Actuality presupposes modal space of unrealized possibilities. The formal statement $\forall S(\text{Actual}(S) \rightarrow \exists P(\text{Possible}(P) \land \neg \text{Actual}(P) \land \text{Accessible}(S, P)))$ rejects pure actualism. (Plain English: If a state S is actual, then there are possible states P that are not actual but are accessible from S — being implies a space of possible alternatives.)[^1][^2][^3]

**C₇: Constraint** — Possibility must be bounded; unlimited potential collapses into indeterminacy [^2][^3]. Given substrate $S$, there exists constraint $C$ such that $\text{Possibilities}(S) \subseteq C \land |C| < \infty$, preventing vacuous permissiveness [^1]. (Plain English: For any substrate, the set of things it can possibly become is contained within some finite constraint — possibilities are limited, not infinite.)[^1]

**C₈: Self-Containment** — Totality must be self-consistent; no contradictions about existence as whole. For any totality $W$, $\text{Totality}(W) \rightarrow \text{Consistent}(W) \land \neg \exists \phi(\phi \in W \land \neg\phi \in W)$ establishes performative validity. (Plain English: If W is meant to be a total set of claims, then W must be consistent and cannot contain both a claim and its negation — wholes cannot be self-contradictory.)[^2][^3][^1]

**C₉: Individuation** — Entities are distinguishable by principle; multiplicity without chaos. The condition $\forall x,y(\text{Entity}(x) \land \text{Entity}(y) \land x \neq y \rightarrow \exists \phi(x \models \phi \land y \not\models \phi))$ grounds logical individuation and singular reference. (Plain English: For any two distinct entities there is at least one property that one has and the other lacks — distinctness is capturable by some distinguishing feature.)[^3][^1][^2]

**C₁₀: Dependency** — Some entities ground others; ontological hierarchies unavoidable. Formally: $\exists x,y(\text{Entity}(x) \land \text{Entity}(y) \rightarrow \exists \text{Grounds}(x,y) \lor \text{Hierarchy})$, establishing foundational layering. (Plain English: There are entities such that one grounds or supports another, i.e., some things depend on others — ontological layers or grounding relations exist.)[^1][^2][^3]

### The Λ-Substrate Constitution

Together, these ten conditions define the **Λ-Substrate**—the minimal ontological architecture enabling multiplicity, unity, and transformation. The Λ-Substrate is not a substance to which properties are added but the simultaneous satisfaction of ontological and logical conditions across all categories, constituting the generative ground of being.[^2][^1]

### Transcendental Necessity

Each ontological condition satisfies the **indispensability criterion**: its negation yields either performative contradiction or systemic incoherence. Denying Divisibility makes differentiation impossible; denying Coherence yields pure fragmentation; denying Persistence destroys temporal intelligibility. These are not empirical facts but **transcendental invariants**—structural requirements that demarcate the intelligible from the incoherent.[^3][^1]
