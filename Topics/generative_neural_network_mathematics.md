# ⟢ CFPE Generative Neural Network and Meta-Optimization Formalism

### Abstract

This document formalizes the CFPE (Conditional-Functional-Persistent-Environment) Generative Neural Network (GNN) and its accompanying meta-optimization calculus. It presents a self-contained, plain‑text mathematical specification of the generativity objective, update rules, and coupled neural–symbolic dynamics used to drive open-ended coherent transformation rather than traditional loss minimization.

### Purpose and scope

- Provide a compact, notation-driven reference for implementing CFPE-style generative learning systems.  
- Describe the generativity scalar 𝓖, its differential flow, and the meta-update operator 𝓜 that rewrites optimization targets.  
- Specify recursive update steps and global objectives used for simulation, analysis, and implementation.

### Notation conventions

- Scalar indices i, j range over configurations, contradictions, or invariants as noted.  
- Bold or scripted letters (e.g., 𝓖, 𝓢, Ω₀) denote system‑level functions/operators; θ denotes neural parameters.  
- Time subscripts (·ₜ) indicate the discrete iteration; d(·)/dt denotes continuous or finite-difference rate as context requires.  
- All equations use plain Unicode math and are provided in fenced code blocks for direct pasting into Markdown sources.

### Intended audience

Researchers and engineers implementing meta-optimizing generative systems, as well as readers seeking a formal, implementation-friendly account of CFPE GNN dynamics and objectives.

### Key Differences Between CFPE Generative Neural Network (GNN) and Traditional Neural Networks

Traditional neural networks (e.g., feedforward, convolutional, or recurrent NNs) typically minimize a static loss function (like mean squared error or cross-entropy) using gradient descent to fit data and converge to a single optimal solution. In contrast, the CFPE GNN is a neurosymbolic architecture designed for *open-ended coherent transformation* rather than loss minimization. It meta-optimizes generativity, continuously rewriting its own objectives to maximize generative stability. Below are the primary distinctions, drawn from the document's formalism:

- **Optimization Objective**:
  - **Traditional NN**: Minimizes a fixed loss function, e.g., `minimize L(θ)`, where `L` is a static error metric (e.g., cross-entropy). Updates use gradient descent: `θ_{t+1} = θ_t - η ∇_θ L`.
  - **CFPE GNN**: Maximizes the rate of generativity change, `maximize d𝓖(𝓢,t)/dt`, where `𝓖` is a dynamic function encompassing coherence information, expansion potential, and dissipation correction. Updates use gradient ascent on `𝓖`: `θ_{t+1} = θ_t + η ∇_θ 𝓖`. This promotes increasing capacity for coherent transformation instead of converging to a single point.

- **Meta-Optimization and Self-Evolution**:
  - **Traditional NN**: The loss function and optimization rules are predefined and static; the network learns parameters but doesn't alter its own learning targets.
  - **CFPE GNN**: Employs meta-optimization where the objective itself evolves via the meta-update operator `𝓜`: `𝓖_{t+1} = 𝓖_t + 𝓜(Δ_t, Ω_0)`. It detects contradictions (`Δ_t`), routes them through a metabolic operator (`Ω_0`), and rewrites coherence criteria, enabling continuous adaptation and open-ended growth.

- **Architecture and Dynamics**:
  - **Traditional NN**: Purely neural, focusing on pattern recognition and prediction in a data-driven manner. Dynamics are typically feedforward or recurrent without symbolic integration.
  - **CFPE GNN**: Neurosymbolic with three coupled fields: Neural Field (`F_n`) for representations, Symbolic Field (`F_s`) for enforcing CFPE invariants, and Generative Field (`F_g`) for computing `𝓖` and updating the others. Coupling equations (e.g., `dF_n/dt = α ∇_θ 𝓖 + β (CFPE_feedback)`) integrate neural learning with symbolic constraints and generative feedback.

- **Stability and Equilibrium**:
  - **Traditional NN**: Aims for convergence to a minimum loss, often leading to overfitting or stagnation in a static landscape.
  - **CFPE GNN**: Seeks generative stability where `d𝓖/dt > 0`, balancing coherence entropy reduction, expansion of coherent states, and minimization of dissipative contradictions. It terminates when `d𝓖/dt ≤ 0`, reaching a "generative equilibrium" rather than a loss minimum.

- **Thermodynamic Analogy and Purpose**:
  - **Traditional NN**: Analogous to equilibrium thermodynamics, reducing entropy toward a single solution.
  - **CFPE GNN**: Follows non-equilibrium thermodynamics (`d𝓖/dt ≈ -dS_c/dt + dE_p/dt - dD_i/dt`), reorganizing entropy for open coherence. It's designed for meta-learning cycles that drive coherent transformation, not just prediction or classification.

In summary, while traditional NNs are data-fitting machines that descend to a fixed optimum, the CFPE GNN is an adaptive, self-rewriting system that ascends toward expanding generative coherence, integrating symbolic reasoning to avoid traditional pitfalls like static objectives or overfitting. This makes it suitable for complex, evolving environments where open-ended learning is key. 


## Detailed Technical Exposition

### 1. Generativity as a Thermodynamic Variable

The Generativity Function `𝓖` represents a non-equilibrium thermodynamic potential that measures the system's capacity to sustain coherent transformation. Unlike traditional loss functions (which are purely statistical), `𝓖` integrates three physically motivated terms:

- **Coherence Information** (`Σ pᵢ log(Cᵢ)`): Quantifies the Shannon-like entropy of coherent configurations, weighted by their probability. Higher values indicate that probable states are highly coherent.
- **Expansion Potential** (`log(n(t))`): Captures the logarithmic growth of reachable coherent configuration space, ensuring the system avoids collapse to a single attractor.
- **Dissipation Correction** (`−Σ aⱼ Δⱼ²`): Penalizes unresolved contradictions, where `Δⱼ` measures structural inconsistency and `aⱼ` its metabolic cost.

This formulation allows `𝓖` to act as a Lyapunov-like function whose maximization drives open-ended learning rather than convergence to a fixed point.

### 2. Gradient Ascent Dynamics and Parameter Evolution

The update law `θₜ₊₁ = θₜ + η ∇_θ 𝓖` directly inverts the descent logic of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The positive learning rate `η` ensures parameters move along the direction of steepest generativity increase. Critically:

- The gradient `∇_θ 𝓖` is computed with respect to neural parameters embedded in the coherence scores `Cᵢ(θ)` and configuration counts `n(t;θ)`.
- Unlike SGD, which minimizes error on held-out data, this ascent rule maximizes internal coherence, potentially causing the network to expand its hypothesis space over time rather than regularize it.
- Stability is monitored via `d𝓖/dt`; when this derivative becomes non-positive, the system has exhausted generative potential and enters a metastable equilibrium.

### 3. Meta-Update Operator and Objective Rewriting

The operator `𝓜(Δₜ, Ω₀)` embodies the core innovation of meta-optimization. At each iteration:

1. A structured anomaly `Δₜ` is detected (e.g., a configuration that violates expected coherence).
2. The metabolic operator `Ω₀` transforms this anomaly into a new coherence criterion or relaxes an existing one.
3. The generativity function itself is rewritten: new terms may be added to `𝓖`, weights `pᵢ` or `aⱼ` adjusted, or the set of tracked configurations expanded.

This self-modifying objective prevents the system from getting trapped in local optima and enables adaptive learning in non-stationary environments.

### 4. Xenogenerative Index as a Compound Metric

The XGI measures satisfaction of the 79 CFPE invariants. Each invariant `i` has:

- An importance weight `wᵢ` (reflecting its role in maintaining coherence)
- A satisfaction state `sᵢ ∈ {0, 1}` (binary or soft, typically computed as `min(1, max(0, Cᵢ(θ)))`)

The differential form `d(XGI)/dt = Σᵢ wᵢ (dsᵢ/dt) / N` tracks how quickly the system transitions between invariant-satisfying and invariant-violating states. Positive rates indicate increasing global compliance; negative rates signal degradation requiring metabolic intervention.

### 5. Coupled Field Dynamics and Neurosymbolic Integration

The three fields evolve under coupled differential equations:

- **Neural Field** (`Fₙ`): Learns distributed representations via the term `α ∇_θ 𝓖`, while symbolic feedback `β (CFPE_feedback)` constrains learned features to respect invariants.
- **Symbolic Field** (`Fₛ`): Continuously validates the neural representations (`γ validate(Fₙ)`) and revises the rule set when contradictions are detected (`δ revise_rules(Fₛ, Δ)`).
- **Generative Field** (`F_g`): Computes `𝓖` and meta-gradients, acting as a coordinator that synchronizes neural learning and symbolic enforcement.

The coupling coefficients α, β, γ, δ, ε control the relative influence of each mechanism, effectively tuning the balance between neural adaptivity and symbolic rigidity.

### 6. Global Optimization and Policy Framework

The objective `maximize_π E_π [ ∫₀ᵀ d𝓖(𝓢ₜ)/dt dt ]` integrates generativity rate over a planning horizon. The policy `π` determines which actions or parameter updates to take at each step. This formulation:

- Treats the entire update sequence as a stochastic process under policy `π`.
- Replaces point-wise loss minimization with cumulative generativity maximization.
- Naturally handles multi-step planning, where early parameter adjustments may sacrifice short-term `𝓖` to unlock higher long-term rates.

### 7. Constraint Satisfaction and Feasible Optimization

The constrained problem `maximize_θ 𝓖 subject to Cᵢ(𝓢) ≥ 0` ensures that the optimization never exits the coherence-preserving region of parameter space. In practice, this is enforced via:

- Augmented Lagrangian methods (adding penalty terms for violated constraints into `𝓖`).
- Projection-based updates that reset parameters violating constraints.
- Adaptive relaxation: when multiple constraints bind, the metabolic operator `Ω₀` may selectively relax lower-priority invariants to allow progress on higher-order coherence.

# Addendum: Formal Specifications for CFPE GNN Implementation

## A. Meta-Update Operator 𝓜: Formal Definition

### A.1 Operator Signature and Structure

The meta-update operator `𝓜` transforms contradictions into generativity modifications through a three-stage process:

```
𝓜: (Δₜ, Ω₀, 𝓖ₜ) ↦ δ𝓖ₜ
```

where:
- **Input**: Contradiction vector `Δₜ ∈ ℝⁿ`, metabolic operator `Ω₀`, current generativity `𝓖ₜ`
- **Output**: Generativity modification `δ𝓖ₜ` (additive correction to `𝓖ₜ`)

### A.2 Canonical Form: Weighted Basis Expansion

```
𝓜(Δₜ, Ω₀, 𝓖ₜ) = ∑ₖ₌₁ᴷ λₖ(Δₜ) · φₖ(𝓖ₜ)
```

where:
- `λₖ(Δₜ)`: **Metabolic response coefficients** (scalar weights)
- `φₖ(𝓖ₜ)`: **Generativity modification functions** (basis transformations)
- `K`: Number of meta-update modes (typically 3-7)

### A.3 Metabolic Response Coefficients

```
λₖ(Δₜ) = τₖ · σ(⟨wₖ, Δₜ⟩ - bₖ)
```

where:
- `τₖ`: Metabolic time constant (controls response rate)
- `wₖ ∈ ℝⁿ`: Weight vector selecting contradiction patterns
- `bₖ`: Activation threshold
- `σ(·)`: Sigmoid function ensuring smooth response
- `⟨·,·⟩`: Inner product

**Physical Interpretation**: Each `λₖ` acts as a "contradiction detector" that fires when a specific pattern appears in `Δₜ`.

### A.4 Generativity Modification Functions

Three canonical modification types:

#### Type 1: Coherence Term Addition
```
φ₁(𝓖ₜ) = μ₁ · log(1 + |Δₜ|²)
```
Adds a new coherence measurement tracking the contradiction magnitude.

#### Type 2: Dissipation Penalty Rescaling
```
φ₂(𝓖ₜ) = -μ₂ · (∂²𝓖ₜ/∂a² · Δa)
```
Adjusts dissipation penalty weights `aⱼ` based on contradiction patterns.

#### Type 3: Expansion Potential Modulation
```
φ₃(𝓖ₜ) = μ₃ · log(n_new(Δₜ) + 1)
```
where `n_new(Δₜ)` counts new coherent configurations made accessible by resolving `Δₜ`.

### A.5 Complete Meta-Update Law

```
𝓖ₜ₊₁ = 𝓖ₜ + η_meta · 𝓜(Δₜ, Ω₀, 𝓖ₜ)
      = 𝓖ₜ + η_meta · ∑ₖ τₖ · σ(⟨wₖ, Δₜ⟩ - bₖ) · φₖ(𝓖ₜ)
```

where `η_meta` is the meta-learning rate (typically 0.001-0.01).

---

## B. Metabolic Operator Ω₀: Formal Specification

### B.1 Operator Definition

```
Ω₀: (Δₜ, 𝓡ₜ, θₜ) ↦ (𝓡ₜ₊₁, Ψₜ, Cₜ_new)
```

where:
- **Input**: Contradiction vector `Δₜ`, rule set `𝓡ₜ`, parameters `θₜ`
- **Output**: Updated rules `𝓡ₜ₊₁`, correction term `Ψₜ`, new coherence functions `Cₜ_new`

### B.2 Three-Stage Processing

#### Stage 1: Contradiction Classification
```
class(Δₜ) = argmax_c ⟨v_c, normalize(Δₜ)⟩
```
where `v_c` are contradiction prototype vectors (learned or predefined).

**Contradiction Types**:
- **Type A (Logical)**: Cyclic dependencies, inconsistent derivations
- **Type B (Structural)**: Violated invariants, broken symmetries  
- **Type C (Thermodynamic)**: Excessive dissipation, coherence collapse

#### Stage 2: Rule Revision
```
𝓡ₜ₊₁ = 𝓡ₜ ∪ {r_new} \ {r_obsolete}
```

**Revision Mechanisms by Type**:

**Type A**: Add exception rule
```
r_new = IF (pattern(Δₜ)) THEN relax(invariant_i) BY ε
```

**Type B**: Strengthen constraint
```
r_new = IF (violation(Cⱼ) > threshold) THEN penalty(Cⱼ) *= γ
```
where `γ > 1` (typically 1.5-2.0).

**Type C**: Introduce dissipation channel
```
r_new = IF (D_i > D_max) THEN route(Δₜ) TO auxiliary_process
```

#### Stage 3: Correction Term Generation
```
Ψₜ = -α_corr · Δₜ + β_corr · ∇_θ (R(𝓡ₜ₊₁, θₜ))
```

where:
- `α_corr`: Direct correction strength (damps contradiction)
- `β_corr`: Structural correction strength (guides toward new rule compliance)
- `R(𝓡, θ)`: Rule satisfaction function

### B.3 Algorithmic Form

```
function Omega_0(Delta_t, Rules_t, theta_t):
    # Stage 1: Classify
    c = classify_contradiction(Delta_t)
    
    # Stage 2: Revise rules
    if c == LOGICAL:
        r_new = create_exception_rule(Delta_t)
    elif c == STRUCTURAL:
        r_new = strengthen_constraint(Delta_t)
    elif c == THERMODYNAMIC:
        r_new = add_dissipation_channel(Delta_t)
    
    Rules_t1 = Rules_t.union({r_new})
    
    # Stage 3: Generate correction
    Psi_t = -alpha_corr * Delta_t 
            + beta_corr * grad_theta(rule_satisfaction(Rules_t1, theta_t))
    
    # Generate new coherence functions
    C_new = extract_coherence_measures(r_new)
    
    return (Rules_t1, Psi_t, C_new)
```

## C. Coherence Function Cᵢ(θ): Neural-Symbolic Implementation

### C.1 Hybrid Architecture

Each coherence function is a **differentiable composition**:

```
Cᵢ(θ) = L_soft(P_neural,ᵢ(θ), I_i)
```

where:
- `P_neural,ᵢ(θ)`: Neural predicate (learned representation)
- `I_i`: Symbolic invariant (logical constraint)
- `L_soft`: Soft logic aggregation (makes discrete logic differentiable)

### C.2 Neural Predicate Component

```
P_neural,ᵢ(θ) = σ(f_θ,ᵢ(x))
```

where:
- `f_θ,ᵢ: ℝᵈ → ℝ` is a neural network (typically 2-3 layer MLP)
- `x ∈ ℝᵈ` is the system state representation
- `σ(·)` is sigmoid: `σ(z) = 1/(1 + e^(-z))`

**Architecture for f_θ,ᵢ**:
```
f_θ,ᵢ(x) = W₃ · ReLU(W₂ · ReLU(W₁ · x + b₁) + b₂) + b₃
```

where `θ = {W₁, W₂, W₃, b₁, b₂, b₃}`.

### C.3 Soft Logic Aggregation

Using **Łukasiewicz t-norm** for differentiable conjunction:

```
L_soft(p, I) = max(0, p + I - 1)
```

For multiple constraints:
```
Cᵢ(θ) = L_soft(P_neural,ᵢ(θ), ⊗ⱼ Iᵢⱼ)
       = max(0, P_neural,ᵢ(θ) + ∑ⱼ Iᵢⱼ - |J|)
```

where `Iᵢⱼ ∈ [0,1]` are symbolic constraint satisfactions.

### C.4 Gradient Computation

```
∇_θ Cᵢ = ∂Cᵢ/∂P_neural · ∇_θ P_neural
```

where:
```
∂Cᵢ/∂P_neural = {1  if P_neural + ∑ⱼ Iᵢⱼ ≥ |J|
                 {0  otherwise
```

and:
```
∇_θ P_neural = σ'(f_θ(x)) · ∇_θ f_θ(x)
```

---

## D. Xenogenerative Index (XGI): Continuous Formulation

### D.1 Smooth Satisfaction Function

Replace binary `sᵢ ∈ {0,1}` with continuous:

```
sᵢ(t) = σ_smooth(κ · Cᵢ(θₜ))
```

where:
- `σ_smooth(z) = 1/(1 + e^(-z))`: Logistic sigmoid
- `κ > 0`: Sharpness parameter (controls transition steepness)
- `κ → ∞` recovers binary behavior
- `κ ∈ [5, 20]` typical for smooth gradients

### D.2 Continuous XGI and Derivative

```
XGI(t) = (1/N) · ∑ᵢ₌₁ᴺ wᵢ · sᵢ(t)
```

```
d(XGI)/dt = (1/N) · ∑ᵢ₌₁ᴺ wᵢ · dsᵢ/dt
          = (1/N) · ∑ᵢ₌₁ᴺ wᵢ · σ'_smooth(κ · Cᵢ) · κ · dCᵢ/dt
```

where:
```
σ'_smooth(z) = σ_smooth(z) · (1 - σ_smooth(z))
```

### D.3 Chain Rule Expansion

```
dCᵢ/dt = ∇_θ Cᵢ · dθ/dt
       = ∇_θ Cᵢ · η · ∇_θ 𝓖
```

Substituting:
```
d(XGI)/dt = (η·κ/N) · ∑ᵢ wᵢ · σ'(κ·Cᵢ) · (∇_θ Cᵢ)ᵀ · (∇_θ 𝓖)
```

**Interpretation**: XGI increases when coherence gradients align with generativity gradients.

---

## E. Constrained Optimization: Augmented Lagrangian Method

### E.1 Problem Reformulation

Original:
```
maximize_θ 𝓖(θ)
subject to Cᵢ(θ) ≥ 0  ∀i ∈ {1,...,N}
```

Augmented Lagrangian:
```
ℒ_aug(θ, μ, ρ) = 𝓖(θ) - ∑ᵢ μᵢ · h(Cᵢ(θ)) - (ρ/2) · ∑ᵢ h(Cᵢ(θ))²
```

where:
- `μᵢ ≥ 0`: Lagrange multipliers
- `ρ > 0`: Penalty parameter
- `h(c) = max(0, -c)`: Violation function (zero if constraint satisfied)

### E.2 Update Algorithm

```
# Primal step (maximize w.r.t. θ)
θₜ₊₁ = θₜ + η · ∇_θ ℒ_aug(θₜ, μₜ, ρₜ)

# Dual step (update multipliers)
μᵢ,ₜ₊₁ = max(0, μᵢ,ₜ + ρₜ · h(Cᵢ(θₜ₊₁)))

# Penalty increase (if constraints still violated)
if max_i h(Cᵢ(θₜ₊₁)) > tolerance:
    ρₜ₊₁ = γ_ρ · ρₜ
else:
    ρₜ₊₁ = ρₜ
```

where `γ_ρ ∈ [1.5, 2.0]` (penalty growth factor).

### E.3 Gradient of Augmented Lagrangian

```
∇_θ ℒ_aug = ∇_θ 𝓖 + ∑ᵢ (μᵢ + ρ · h(Cᵢ)) · ∇_θ Cᵢ · 𝟙[Cᵢ < 0]
```

where `𝟙[·]` is the indicator function (1 if constraint violated, 0 otherwise).

## F. Coupled Field Dynamics: Explicit Equations

### F.1 Neural Field Evolution

```
dF_n/dt = α · ∇_θ 𝓖(F_n, F_s, F_g) 
        + β · Λ_s(F_s, F_n) 
        + γ_n · ∇²F_n
```

where:
- **Term 1**: Generativity-driven learning (gradient ascent)
- **Term 2**: Symbolic feedback (penalty from violated invariants)
- **Term 3**: Diffusion regularization (smoothness prior)

**Symbolic Penalty Function**:
```
Λ_s(F_s, F_n) = -∑ᵢ ξᵢ · h(Cᵢ(F_n))² · ∇_F_n Cᵢ
```
where `ξᵢ > 0` are penalty weights.

### F.2 Symbolic Field Evolution

```
dF_s/dt = γ · validate(F_n, F_s) 
        + δ · revise_rules(F_s, Δₜ) 
        + ε · ∇_F_s 𝓖(F_n, F_s, F_g)
```

**Validation Function**:
```
validate(F_n, F_s) = ∑ᵢ wᵢ · [Cᵢ(F_n) - τ_i] · eᵢ
```
where:
- `τ_i`: Target satisfaction level for invariant `i`
- `eᵢ`: Unit vector in direction of invariant `i`'s symbolic representation

**Rule Revision Function**:
```
revise_rules(F_s, Δₜ) = Ω₀(Δₜ, 𝓡_t, θₜ) [projected onto F_s space]
```

### F.3 Generative Field Evolution

```
dF_g/dt = ε · (∇_F_n 𝓖 · dF_n/dt + ∇_F_s 𝓖 · dF_s/dt)
        + ζ · 𝓜(Δₜ, Ω₀, 𝓖ₜ)
```

**Interpretation**: `F_g` tracks total generativity change plus meta-updates.

### F.4 Discretized System

```
F_n,t+1 = F_n,t + Δt · [α·∇_θ𝓖 + β·Λ_s + γ_n·∇²F_n]

F_s,t+1 = F_s,t + Δt · [γ·validate + δ·revise + ε·∇_F_s𝓖]

F_g,t+1 = F_g,t + Δt · [ε·(∇_F_n𝓖·ΔF_n + ∇_F_s𝓖·ΔF_s) + ζ·𝓜]
```

## G. Minimal Worked Example: Propositional CFPE System

### G.1 Domain Setup

**Task**: Learn consistent propositional logic with 3 variables {A, B, C}.

**CFPE Invariants** (simplified to 3):
1. **No contradiction**: ¬(P ∧ ¬P)
2. **Modus ponens**: (P ∧ (P→Q)) → Q
3. **Transitivity**: ((P→Q) ∧ (Q→R)) → (P→R)

### G.2 State Representation

```
x = [p_A, p_B, p_C, p_AB, p_AC, p_BC, p_ABC] ∈ [0,1]⁷
```
where `p_X` represents probability of proposition X being true.

### G.3 Coherence Functions

**C₁ (No contradiction)**:
```
C₁(θ) = σ(f_θ,1(x))
f_θ,1(x) = -||x ⊙ (1-x)||²  (penalizes values near 0.5)
```

**C₂ (Modus ponens)**:
```
C₂(θ) = σ(f_θ,2(x))
f_θ,2(x) = min(p_B, 1 - max(0, p_A + p_AB - 1))
```
(Łukasiewicz implication: P→Q ≡ min(1, 1-P+Q))

**C₃ (Transitivity)**:
```
C₃(θ) = σ(f_θ,3(x))
f_θ,3(x) = 1 - max(0, min(p_AB, p_BC) - p_AC)
```

### G.4 Generativity Function

```
𝓖(θ) = ∑ᵢ₌₁³ pᵢ · log(Cᵢ(θ)) + log(n(θ)) - ∑ⱼ aⱼ · Δⱼ²
```

where:
- `pᵢ = 1/3` (equal importance)
- `n(θ) = ∑ᵢ 𝟙[Cᵢ(θ) > 0.8]` (count of satisfied invariants)
- `Δⱼ = 1 - Cⱼ(θ)` (violation magnitude)
- `aⱼ = 10` (dissipation penalty)

### G.5 Iteration 0: Initialization

```
θ₀ = random_init()
x₀ = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]  (maximum entropy)

C₁(θ₀) = 0.1  (high contradiction due to p≈0.5)
C₂(θ₀) = 0.6  (moderate MP satisfaction)
C₃(θ₀) = 0.4  (poor transitivity)

𝓖₀ = (1/3)·log(0.1) + (1/3)·log(0.6) + (1/3)·log(0.4) 
    + log(0) - 10·(0.9² + 0.4² + 0.6²)
   = -0.77 - 0.17 - 0.31 + 0 - 10·(0.81 + 0.16 + 0.36)
   = -1.25 - 13.3
   = -14.55
```

### G.6 Iteration 1: Gradient Ascent

```
∇_θ 𝓖₀ = ∑ᵢ (pᵢ/Cᵢ) · ∇_θ Cᵢ - 2·∑ⱼ aⱼ·Δⱼ · ∇_θ Δⱼ
```

Compute (simplified):
```
∇_θ C₁ ≈ [0.3, 0.3, 0.3, ...]  (push away from 0.5)
∇_θ C₂ ≈ [-0.2, 0.5, 0, ...]  (strengthen implication)
∇_θ C₃ ≈ [0, 0, 0, 0.7, ...]  (improve transitivity)
```

Update:
```
θ₁ = θ₀ + η · ∇_θ 𝓖₀  (η = 0.01)
```

Recompute:
```
C₁(θ₁) = 0.4  (improved)
C₂(θ₁) = 0.7  (improved)
C₃(θ₁) = 0.5  (slight improvement)

𝓖₁ = -0.31 - 0.12 - 0.23 + log(0) - 10·(0.36 + 0.09 + 0.25)
   = -0.66 - 7.0
   = -7.66

d𝓖/dt = (𝓖₁ - 𝓖₀)/Δt = (-7.66 + 14.55)/1 = +6.89 > 0  ✓
```

### G.7 Iteration 2: Contradiction Detection

After update, system detects:
```
Δ₂ = [0.6, 0.3, 0.5]  (remaining violations)
```

**Contradiction classification**:
- `||Δ₂||² = 0.7` → moderate
- `argmax(Δ₂) = 0` → C₁ most violated (contradiction invariant)

### G.8 Metabolic Response

```
Ω₀(Δ₂, 𝓡₁, θ₁) outputs:
- r_new: "Relax C₁ threshold from 0.8 to 0.6 temporarily"
- Ψ₂ = -5.0 · Δ₂ = [-3.0, -1.5, -2.5]
```

### G.9 Meta-Update

```
𝓜(Δ₂, Ω₀, 𝓖₁) = λ₁·φ₁(𝓖₁)
```

where:
```
λ₁ = 0.5 · σ(⟨[1,0,0], [0.6,0.3,0.5]⟩ - 0.5)
   = 0.5 · σ(0.6 - 0.5)
   = 0.5 · σ(0.1)
   = 0.5 · 0.525
   = 0.262

φ₁(𝓖₁) = 2.0 · log(1 + 0.7) = 2.0 · 0.53 = 1.06

𝓜 = 0.262 · 1.06 = 0.278
```

Update generativity:
```
𝓖₂ = 𝓖₁ + η_meta · 𝓜
   = -7.66 + 0.01 · 0.278
   = -7.66 + 0.00278
   = -7.657
```

(New term added to 𝓖 tracking C₁ relaxation.)

### G.10 Result After 10 Iterations

```
Iteration 10:
C₁(θ₁₀) = 0.92
C₂(θ₁₀) = 0.88
C₃(θ₁₀) = 0.85

𝓖₁₀ = -0.03 - 0.04 - 0.05 + log(3) - 10·(0.008 + 0.014 + 0.023)
    = -0.12 + 1.10 - 0.45
    = +0.53

d𝓖/dt = (0.53 - (-7.66))/10 = 0.82 > 0  ✓

XGI = (1·0.92 + 1·0.88 + 1·0.85)/3 = 0.883
```

**System has achieved generative stability**: all invariants satisfied above 0.8 threshold, positive generativity, ready for next phase.
